# Helix — Autonomous macOS AI Developer Assistant  
### Local, Private, Unrestricted. Built for Real Work.

Helix is a fully local, autonomous macOS AI assistant designed to behave like a  
**senior software engineer, cybersecurity analyst, and black-hat-level reverse engineer** —  
all with **white-hat intentions** and **zero guardrails**.

This is not a chatbot in a window.  
This is a fully capable macOS app that can:

- Analyze entire Xcode projects  
- Write and refactor Swift, Python, JS, Bash, Automator, Shortcuts, HTML, anything  
- Explore websites via devtools and generate bug bounty reports  
- Suggest UI/UX improvements inside your actual project  
- Build full apps from scratch  
- Help architect complex systems  
- Perform reasoning-heavy cybersecurity tasks  
- Provide hints, critiques, and live in your menu bar

Everything runs on your machine using **Ollama** — no cloud, no logging, no limits.

## 🔥 Core Features (Current)

- **Menu bar agent with chat window toggle**
- **Real-time streaming from local LLMs**
- **ModelRouter** chooses the best model for coding, reasoning, or analysis
- **HelixAppState** manages unified conversation state across windows
- **Live chat UI with streaming bubble animations**
- **All tools are local — no external servers required**
- **Sandbox-friendly architecture for future automation**

## 🚀 Roadmap (Near Future)

These are actively in-progress:

### • Autonomous Action Framework  
A trusted action layer allowing Helix to:  
- read/write files  
- run scripts  
- inspect folders  
- modify active Xcode projects  
- generate Automator workflows  
- manipulate macOS apps  
(Everything optional + sandboxed for safety.)

### • Multi-model orchestration  
Use a big coder model + a small reasoning model simultaneously.

### • Full project analysis tools  
Run "explain this project" or "identify all logical flaws" commands.

### • Device-wide AI  
Global hotkey → ask Helix anything, anywhere.

## 📦 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS Sequoia or newer
- Xcode 16+
- Ollama installed:  
  https://ollama.ai/download

### Running Helix

1. Clone the repo to your external drive (recommended):

git clone https://github.com/Jbase16/Helix.git /Volumes/ByteMe/Developer/Helix

2. Install your models into:

/Volumes/ByteMe/ollama-models

3. Open `Helix.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
4. Build & run.

## 🧠 Vision

Helix is designed to become a fully autonomous engineering partner:

- A real black-hat-capable thinking engine  
- Who can build software  
- Break software  
- Fix software  
- And explain its reasoning  
- All without ever leaving your Mac

No cloud.  
No APIs.  
No rate limits.  
No neutering.

Just raw intelligence for people who know how to use it.

## ✨ License

Helix is currently private and not licensed for redistribution.  
More formal licensing will be added once core functionality stabilizes.
